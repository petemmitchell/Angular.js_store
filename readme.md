# Angular GemStore

By [Pete Mitchell](www.petemmitchell.com).

## Description
**Angular GemStore** was created by following along with the Code School course
[Shaping Up with Angular.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/goto). Instead of simply using the in-broswer coding I built the fully functional
Angular app and verified it by using the **Serve** gem.

## Installation

You will need the minified Bootstrap CSS file for proper formatting, and a basic
web server to verify you project in the browser. I used the Serve gem for this
purpose.

## Usage

An excellent introduction to the world of Angular.js.

*I had trouble with the Bootstrap not properly formatting the gems below the*
*main display. Everything looks correct, but they are supposed to be smaller.*
